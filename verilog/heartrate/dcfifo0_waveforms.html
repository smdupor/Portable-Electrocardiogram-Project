<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file dcfifo0.v </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of scfifo megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design dcfifo0.v. The design dcfifo0.v has a depth of 16384 words of 1 bits each. The output of the fifo is unregistered. The fifo is in legacy synchronous mode. The data becomes available after 'rdreq' is asserted; 'rdreq' acts as a read request. </P>
